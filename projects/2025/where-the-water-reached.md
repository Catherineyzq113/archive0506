Flood hazards are one of most frequent and expensive natural hazards in America.
This trend of increasing risk is pushing policy makers, real estates, and insurance markets to update their system in order to close loss that is increasing every year.
But what should the individuals do?

My interest in this issue began with the repetitive floods I witnessed while living in Louisiana. Within five years, I experienced two major events (in 2016 and 2021) where water rose over five feet in my community. These floods caused millions in infrastructure damage, displacing families and burdening those without flood insurance.

Just last year (2024), there were twelve billion-dollar flood-related disasters in the U.S.—a number that continues to rise.

Unlike homeowners insurance, which is mandated by mortgage lenders, flood insurance remains optional—especially for homes outside high-risk FEMA zones. Yet over 20% of all NFIP claims come from those very areas.

Most homeowners policies exclude rising water and flooding, even those triggered by hurricanes. Without a separate flood policy, the financial burden falls on individuals, often unexpectedly.

This raises a critical question: **Why aren’t users presented with this risk clearly when making housing decisions?**

Through this project, I explore how behavioral biases and bounded rationality shape decision-making. Many buyers prioritize upfront costs, filter listings for convenience, and assume insurance will catch what the platform doesn’t.

The homebuying process is fragmented—steps from search to closing are messy, and risk is rarely surfaced in ways that connect with buyers’ lived concerns.

My approach reframes risk not as abstract data, but as a cost as a way to make vulnerability tangible for those navigating decisions with limited resources.

This isn’t about predicting market trends or prices. It’s about contextualizing what risk means for people making deeply personal investments in uncertain futures.

The tool prototype guides users through a simple flow:
1.	Landing Page — A brief overview and entry point.
2.	Perception Q&A — To understand the user’s priorities and awareness.
3.	Property Report — Presents localized insights and cost breakdowns.
4.	Explore Spatial Data — Interactive maps and overlays connect individual choices with broader patterns of flood risk.

**This project is not just a critique—it’s a call to action.**

It invites homebuyers to recognize risk, contribute their stories, and rethink how housing markets can reflect lived vulnerability. It asks whether shared awareness could ripple outward, reshaping how we price, plan, and protect communities in the face of accelerating climate hazards.

As of last month (April 2025), FEMA and other climate-related agencies are facing proposed federal funding cuts. If approved, these changes threaten to erode the tools and research we rely on to build resilience—especially in frontline communities with fewer resources.

When the cost of disasters outpaces the capacity of states to respond, it’s not just infrastructure that’s at risk—it’s our ability to act collectively and proactively.
